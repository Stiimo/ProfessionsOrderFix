## Professions Order Fix

**Professions Order Fix** is a minimalistic addon designed to help players complete crafting orders for certain broken recipes that cannot be processed through the default Blizzard interface. This addon is based on Blizzard's own code but includes a workaround to handle the broken orders.

### Supported Recipes

Below is the list of broken recipes that this addon currently fixes:

- **Warm Sunrise Bracers**
- **Cool Sunset Bracers**

This list is maintained manually, so if new broken recipes are discovered, they will need to be added to the addon.

### How To Use

This addon is designed to be used alongside Blizzard's default professions frame. It is advised to have the professions window open when using the addon for it to function properly.

You can open the addon's window via chat commands. The following commands are supported:

- `/pof help` — Displays the help message with a list of available commands.
- `/pof version` — Shows the addon's version.
- `/pof toggle` — Opens or closes the addon's main window.

### Note

This addon is a temporary workaround designed to fix specific broken crafting orders in the Professions system. I do not plan to extend or add new functionality, as this is solely intended to address an issue until Blizzard provides an official fix.

If you encounter any issues with the addon or discover new broken recipes that aren't yet supported, please report them by opening an issue or contacting me directly. I will address them as soon as possible.
